## Someone - Chat Bot
Someone utilizes GPT-3 to deliver a unique chat bot app experience. The goal of 'Someone' is too allow a user to define a the style of the chat bot, that can essentially be paramitised to be anyone desired. 

#### App

Built with Swift and Swift UI, Someone was built for the 2 day UQCS Hackathon 2021.  With a team of three people, two of which were completely new to developing, we were able to build a deployable app that, while limited in its scope, achieved it's desired functionality.
